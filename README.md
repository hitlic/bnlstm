# Batch normalized LSTM

### 实现batch normalized LSTM
An implementation of [Recurrent Batch Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09025) by Cooijmans et al. in TensorFlow together with a reimplementation of their results on sequential MNIST.

A short writeup on [Olav Nymoen's blog](http://olavnymoen.com/2016/07/07/rnn-batch-normalization)

### Requirements

- Tensorflow 0.9
- python 2.x

### Acknowledgement

- [Cooijmans implementation](https://github.com/cooijmanstim/recurrent-batch-normalization)
